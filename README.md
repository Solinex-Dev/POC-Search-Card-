## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Solinex-Dev/POC-Search-Card-.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd POC-Search-Card-

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── SearchCard.jsx    # Main search component
├── App.jsx               # Root component
├── main.jsx             # Entry point
├── index.css            # Global styles with Tailwind
└── assets/              # Static assets
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Tailwind CSS
The project uses Tailwind CSS v3.4 with custom configuration:
- ES modules syntax
- Content paths configured for React/Vite
- Custom color schemes for search highlighting

### Search Algorithm
The search functionality uses:
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching
- Keyword-based scoring
- Priority ranking (exact matches first)

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Cards
1. Add new card object to the `cards` array in `SearchCard.jsx`
2. Include relevant keywords for search functionality
3. Choose appropriate Lucide icon
4. Set unique color scheme

### Modifying Search Behavior
- Update `getMatchingCards()` function for different ranking logic
- Modify keyword arrays for different search terms
- Adjust visual effects in the card rendering logic
